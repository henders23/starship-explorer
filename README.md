# Starship Explorer

A narrative space adventure in the spirit of *Starship Traveller* (Fighting
Fantasy #4) — but instead of a branching paragraph book, an open, seeded galaxy.

You captain a ship thrown far from home by a jump anomaly. Fuel is finite, the
crew are named and die permanently, and the only thing that actually wins the
game is **information**: fragments of astrogation lore, gathered from traders,
ruins, derelicts and prisoners, each one narrowing down which of the galaxy's
stars hides the way back. Some of those fragments are lies.

When you think you know where home is, you commit everything to one jump.

## Status

**Milestone 2 complete** — the deduction is playable and winnable. Gather
accounts of the anomaly, decide who to believe, catch the liars by their
contradictions, and commit to the Long Jump. No travel, crew or combat yet.

npm run mystery -- --seed voyager --walkthrough   # inspect a generated puzzle
npm run mystery -- --sweep 300                    # generation statistics
npm test
```

## Stack

TypeScript · React · Vite · Tailwind · Vitest — with a pure, deterministic,
seeded rules engine that knows nothing about React. The engine never calls
`Math.random`: a seed plus an action log must always replay to the same state.
